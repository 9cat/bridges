The Seven Bridges of Königsberg
==================================================

The city of Königsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) was built around two rivers with [seven bridges](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seven_Bridges_of_K%C3%B6nigsberg). For years the residents tried to cross each bridge without crossing any of them more than once.

[Leonhard Euler](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler) proved that it was impossible to cross all the bridges without repeating and laid the foundation for graph theory and modern topology at the same time.

This project is an iPad and iPhone game based on those famous bridges.  Each level presents a puzzle with bridges to cross, houses to visit, and sometimes coins to collect.

This game is currently under development and not ready to play yet.  When it's done I'll release it in the App store.
