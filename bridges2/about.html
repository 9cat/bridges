                The city of K&ouml;nigsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia) was built around two rivers with seven bridges.  For years the residents tried to cross each bridge without repeating any of them.  Many claimed they'd completed the walk in the middle of a drunken night, but couldn't repeat the feat in the light of day.

                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euler">Leonhard Euler</a> proved it was impossible to cross all the bridges once and only once and laid the foundation for graph theory and modern topology.  The math that drives this game is used in compuer science, bioinformatics, topology, and many other areas.

                The Seven Bridges of K&ouml;nigsberg uses crazy maps, bridges, houses, tolls, and subways to create challenging puzzles.  Each level is designed as a graph, and unlike the real bridges all of these are solvable.
